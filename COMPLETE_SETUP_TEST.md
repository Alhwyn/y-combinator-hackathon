# ðŸš€ Complete Frontend + Backend Setup & Testing

## Overview

Your system has two parts:

1. **Backend** - Agents running on Railway (already deployed)
2. **Frontend** - Live dashboard showing video feeds

Let's test everything end-to-end!

---

## âœ… Step 1: Verify Backend (Railway Agents)

### Check Railway Deployment

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Check your service status: Should show **"Active"**
3. Click **"View Logs"** - Look for:

```
[info]: Starting Multi-Agent Browser Testing System...
[info]: Configuration: 5 agents, chromium browser
[info]: Spawning 5 agents...
[info]: All 5 agents spawned successfully
```

### Check Supabase Database

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to **Table Editor** â†’ **agents** table
3. You should see **5 agents** with:
   - `status: 'idle'` or `'busy'`
   - `last_heartbeat`: Recent timestamp
   - `browser_type: 'chromium'`

âœ… **Backend is working if you see 5 active agents!**

---

## âœ… Step 2: Enable Live Streaming (Frontend)

### Add Environment Variables to Railway

1. **Railway Dashboard** â†’ Your Service â†’ **"Variables"**
2. Add these **4 variables**:

```env
ENABLE_LIVE_STREAM=true
LIVE_STREAM_PORT=3001
LIVE_STREAM_FPS=2
LIVE_STREAM_QUALITY=60
```

3. Click **"Deploy"** or wait for auto-deploy
4. Wait 1-2 minutes for redeploy

### Verify Stream Server Started

Check Railway logs for:

```
[info]: âœ… Video stream server started on port 3001
[info]: ðŸ“Š Dashboard: http://localhost:3001/dashboard
```

âœ… **Frontend is ready if you see these logs!**

---

## âœ… Step 3: Test Frontend Dashboard

### Open Dashboard

Visit: https://multi-agent-testing-production.up.railway.app/dashboard

### What You Should See:

```
ðŸŽ¬ Agent Live Dashboard
Watch your AI agents perform QA testing in real-time

[Stats]
Active Agents: 5 | Running Tests: 0 | Stream FPS: 0

[5 Agent Cards showing]
- agent-d3e76826 [Online] [Waiting for stream...] Test: Idle
- agent-1fc0a5d6 [Online] [Waiting for stream...] Test: Idle
- agent-a507e18c [Online] [Waiting for stream...] Test: Idle
- agent-03cf2b4d [Online] [Waiting for stream...] Test: Idle
- agent-xxxxx    [Online] [Waiting for stream...] Test: Idle
```

âœ… **Frontend is working if you see 5 online agents!**

---

## âœ… Step 4: Test Complete System (Backend + Frontend)

Now let's run tests and watch them execute live!

### Option A: Using the Test Script

```bash
cd /Users/alhwyngeonzon/Programming/yc-supabase
./test-railway-agents.sh
```

### Option B: Manual Testing

```bash
# Load sample tests
npm run load:samples
```

### What Happens:

1. **In Supabase** (backend):

   - `test_cases` table: 4 tests added with `status='pending'`
   - Agents claim tests: `status` changes to `'running'`
   - Tests complete: `status` changes to `'completed'`

2. **In Dashboard** (frontend):

   - **Stats update**: "Running Tests: 1" (or more)
   - **Agent picks test**: Test ID appears (e.g., "16291c06...")
   - **ðŸŽ¬ VIDEO APPEARS**: Live browser screenshots at 2 FPS!
   - **Agent completes**: Goes back to "Idle"

3. **What You'll See in Video**:
   - Browser navigating to websites
   - Pages loading
   - Elements being interacted with
   - All in real-time!

âœ… **System is fully working when you see live video!**

## ðŸ§ª Full Test Sequence

### Terminal Window 1: Load Tests and Watch

```bash
# Go to project directory
cd /Users/alhwyngeonzon/Programming/yc-supabase

# Load 4 sample tests
npm run load:samples

# Wait 5 seconds, then load more
sleep 5 && npm run load:samples

# Keep loading tests for continuous demo
for i in {1..5}; do
  npm run load:samples
  sleep 10
done
```

### Browser: Watch Dashboard

Keep https://multi-agent-testing-production.up.railway.app/dashboard open

Watch for:

- Stats changing (Running Tests goes up/down)
- Agents claiming tests
- Video feeds appearing
- FPS counter updating

### Terminal Window 2: Monitor Logs (Optional)

```bash
# Watch Railway logs live
railway logs -f

# Or check Supabase realtime
# Go to: Supabase â†’ Table Editor â†’ test_results
# Enable real-time updates
```

## ðŸ“Š Complete Testing Checklist

### Backend (Agents)

- [ ] Railway deployment shows "Active"
- [ ] Railway logs show agents spawned
- [ ] Supabase shows 5 agents in `agents` table
- [ ] Agents have recent `last_heartbeat`
- [ ] Agent `status` is 'idle' or 'busy'

### Frontend (Dashboard)

- [ ] Dashboard URL loads successfully
- [ ] 5 agent cards visible
- [ ] All agents show "Online" status
- [ ] Stats displayed at top (0/0/0 initially)
- [ ] WebSocket connection established

### Integration (Backend + Frontend)

## ðŸ”§ Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "Dashboard not loading"

**Check:**

```bash
# Verify Railway deployment
railway status

# Check if port 3001 is exposed
# Look in Railway logs for:
[info]: âœ… Video stream server started on port 3001
```

**Fix:**

- Redeploy Railway service
- Check environment variables are set
- Clear browser cache

---

### Issue: "Agents not appearing in dashboard"

**Check:**

```bash
# Verify environment variable
echo $ENABLE_LIVE_STREAM  # Should be "true"

# Check Railway environment variables
# Go to Railway â†’ Variables â†’ Verify ENABLE_LIVE_STREAM=true
```

**Fix:**
Add `ENABLE_LIVE_STREAM=true` to Railway variables and redeploy

---

### Issue: "No video appearing"

**Cause:** Agents are idle (not running tests)

**Fix:**

```bash
# Load tests!
npm run load:samples
```

Video **only appears when tests are running**. This is normal behavior.

---

### Issue: "Video is choppy or slow"

**Adjust quality:**

In Railway variables, change:

```env
LIVE_STREAM_FPS=1          # Lower FPS
LIVE_STREAM_QUALITY=40     # Lower quality
```

Trade-off: Lower values = less CPU/bandwidth, but less smooth video

---
