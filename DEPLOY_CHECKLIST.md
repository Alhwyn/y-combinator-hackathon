## Verify Deployment (2 minutes)

### Check Railway Logs

- [ ] Go to Railway ‚Üí Your Service ‚Üí "View Logs"
- [ ] Look for: `‚úÖ All 5 agents spawned successfully`
- [ ] Look for: `‚úÖ System started successfully`

### Check Supabase Database

- [ ] Go to Supabase ‚Üí Table Editor ‚Üí `agents` table
- [ ] You should see 5 agents with `status = 'idle'`
- [ ] Agent names like: `agent-a1b2c3d4`, `agent-e5f6g7h8`, etc.

### Load Test Cases

From your local machine:

```bash
npm run load:samples
```

- [ ] Check Railway logs - agents should start executing tests
- [ ] Check Supabase ‚Üí `test_results` table - results should appear
- [ ] Check Supabase Storage ‚Üí `test-screenshots` - screenshots should appear

## üéâ Success Criteria

You're done when you see:

- ‚úÖ Railway shows "Deployed successfully"
- ‚úÖ 5 agents registered in Supabase `agents` table
- ‚úÖ Tests completing in `test_results` table
- ‚úÖ Screenshots appearing in Supabase Storage
- ‚úÖ No errors in Railway logs

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Railway shows "Deploy Failed"

- Check all environment variables are set correctly
- Make sure `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` is the service key, not anon key
- Review Railway build logs for specific errors

### Agents not appearing in database

- Verify `SUPABASE_URL` is correct (should include https://)
- Check `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` has correct permissions
- Look for connection errors in Railway logs

### Tests not running

- Make sure test cases exist: `SELECT * FROM test_cases WHERE status='pending'`
- Load samples if none exist: `npm run load:samples`
- Check agents are idle: `SELECT * FROM agents WHERE status='idle'`
