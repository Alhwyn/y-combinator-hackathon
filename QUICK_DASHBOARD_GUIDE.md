## 🚀 How to Use (30 seconds)

### 1. Open the Dashboard

Go to: **https://replication.ngrok.io/dashboard/**

### 2. Wait for Connection

Look for: **✅ Connected to stream server** (green text at top)

### 3. Watch the Magic!

- Each card shows a **live video** of an AI bot testing a website
- Watch them click buttons, fill forms, and navigate pages **autonomously**

---

## 📺 What You're Watching

Each AI agent:

1. Opens a website (like Wordle, shopping sites, forms)
2. Takes a screenshot every 2-5 seconds
3. AI analyzes what it sees
4. Decides what to do next (click, type, scroll, etc.)
5. Executes the action
6. Repeats until test completes

**You see all of this happening LIVE in the video streams!**

## 📊 Understanding the Dashboard

### Top Stats (3 numbers)

- **Active Agents**: How many AI bots are online
- **Running Tests**: How many tests are currently executing
- **Stream FPS**: Video quality (1-5 is normal)

### Agent Cards (the grid below)

Each card shows:

- **Agent Name**: The bot's ID (e.g., "agent-1")
- **Green Dot**: Online and working
- **Live Video**: Real-time stream of what the bot is doing
- **Test ID**: Which test is running (or "Idle" if waiting)

---

## ✅ Everything Working When You See:

- ✅ Connection status is green
- ✅ Numbers in the stats (not all zeros)
- ✅ Agent cards appearing in the grid
- ✅ Videos showing websites being tested
- ✅ Green pulsing dots next to agent names

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

**No agents showing?**
→ Wait 30 seconds, they might be starting up

**Connection red/disconnected?**
→ It will auto-reconnect in 10-30 seconds

**Videos frozen?**
→ Normal! AI takes screenshots every 2-5 seconds (not continuous video)

**All zeros in stats?**
→ No tests are running right now (this is okay)

**Page won't load?**
→ Refresh the page, check your internet connection

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use a laptop/desktop** - Better experience than mobile
2. **Keep the tab open** - Only streams when you're watching
3. **Wait 30 seconds** - Give agents time to connect
4. **Watch the stats** - Quick health check of the system
5. **Low FPS is normal** - AI tests in "steps", not continuous video
